# configs
My personal configurations for various things in GNU/Linux. My vision is a FOSS world where FOSS does not go unacknowledged or substituted for proprietary, and every single user has the freedom they deserve. The things i produce are free to use and manipulate as anyone may wish.

NOTE: I will happily take criticism and feedback from people who are having issues with what i produce, but please do NOT lash out at me for my mistakes. I make mistakes and I act to fix them.
